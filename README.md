BrightEdge interview project.

I made this a while back. I can't give details on what they asked me to do, because I believe that information is copyrighted,
at least to some extent. This is my implementation, and it got me an interview. It probably isn't the best way to do it,
but it works well enough, and is fairly documented.

Feel free to use as a guideline for web scraping projects. If you turn it into BrightEdge to try to get an interview, they're
probably smart enough to find this code online and know you're cheating. Plus, this is licensed under the MIT license, which
means you need to leave my information attached.

Take care.
